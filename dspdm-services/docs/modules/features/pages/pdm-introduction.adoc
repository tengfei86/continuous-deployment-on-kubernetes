== Master Data

Master data includes entities that are either static and/or rarely change over the life or the field. It includes:

* Area
* Field
* Pool/Reservoir
* Formation
* Zone
* Platform
* Well, Wellbore, and Well Completion
* Well Tubular
* Network
* Pipeline
* Facilities
* Equipment, including well equipment (tubular, pumps)
* Business Associate

While well and completions may change after workover, pumps may be switched, and network may be expanded, the frequency of the changes are nowhere near daily or monthly. The latter is categorized into operational data.

Right now, the PDM have created 25 master tables. Expanding is in progress.

[width="100%",cols="24%,76%",options="header",]
|===
|Table Name |Description
|AREA |AREA: Describes geographic areas, such as country, province, district etc.
|ASSET |ASSET:
|BUSINESS_ASSOCIATE |BUSINESS ASSOCIATE: The Business Associate table serves as a validation/lookup table associating the code values for each business associate with their full name and information about company partners and other parties with whom business is conducted (e.g., oil companies, applicants, owners, contractors, operators, original operators, previous operators, etc.).
|EQUIPMENT |EQUIPMENT: Use this table to describe pieces of equipment that are real. May be any kind of equipment, microscopes, gauges etc.
|FACILITY |FACILITY: A collection of surface equipment and meters which facilitate the production, injection or disposition of products. This equipment supports any operation in the processing, development and transportation of products, such as pipeline, tank, battery etc.
|FACILITY_EQUIPMENT |FACILITY EQUIPMENT: Generally, a facility is usually considered to be an object that exists somewhere on the earth (or under or over). In most systems, these facilities are given identifiers that indicate a PLACE on a network, and not a specific piece of equipment. This table can be used to keep track of which equipment is occupying that facility place at a given time. A single facility can thus be associated with many physical pieces of equipment over its life span.
|FIELD |FIELD: A geographical area defined for administrative and legal purposes. The field name refers to the surface area, although at times it may refer to both the surface and the underground productive zones. In the United States a field is often an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on, or related to, the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition. Fields are usually defined at a province/state level but possibly are done at the district level.
|FORMATION |FORMATION: Represents a specific layer of reservoir rock through which fluids flow from a reservoir into a string of production tubing. This table can be used to prorate production from a production string back to individual formations.
|NETWORK |NETWORK: A network system that conveys the individual-well production or that of a group of wells to a central system or terminal location.
|NETWORK_NODE |NETWORK NODE: Network nodes are the physical pieces that make up the network. They usually include any device than both receives and then output the production.
|NODE |NODE: This table is used to record the nodes information of networks, each record of the node will associate an entity (An entity could be a well, facility, equipment or a network)
|PIPELINE |PIPELINE: A collection of information of pipelines. Oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes which are usually buried. The oil is moved through the pipelines by pump stations along the pipeline. Natural gas (and similar gaseous fuels) are pressurized into liquids know as Natural Gas Liquids（NGLs).
|PIPELINE_SEGMENT |PIPELINE SEGMENT: A collection of information of pipeline segments. A segment is defined as a section of pipeline within the pipeline system. A pipeline system is made up of one or more segments of pipeline or a group of pipelines.
|PLATFORM |PLATFORM: An oil platform, offshore platform, or offshore drilling rig is a large structure with facilities for well drilling to explore, extract, store, and process petroleum and natural gas which lies in rock formations beneath the seabed. Many oil platforms will also contain facilities to accommodate their workforce. Once the exploratory drilling phase is over and geologists have determined that a petroleum reservoir is worth the massive expense, oil companies prepare to establish an offshore production platform. In this table, the production platform or pad is suggested.
|SCENARIO |SCENARIO: A intelligible description of a possible situation, which is based on a complex series of influence factors
|WELL |WELL: A well is the location on the surface of the earth or sea bed where the drill bit is planned to penetrate or does penetrate the earth to establish or rework a well. The well will be the same with `Well Origin' in PPDM.
|WELL_COMPLETION |WELL COMPLETION: The Well Completion table identifies the completion activity in the wellbore. Since a wellbore may have multiple completions, the completion observation number uniquely identifies each occurrence.
|WELL_DIR_SRVY |WELL DIRECTIONAL SURVEY: The Well Directional Survey table contains header information about directional surveys which have been performed on a wellbore. This downhole survey charts the degree of departure of the wellbore from vertical and the direction of departure. Since many directional surveys can be conducted on a wellbore, the survey number is included as part of the primary key to uniquely identify the survey.
|WELL_EQUIPMENT |WELL EQUIPMENT: A collection of the equipment that installed at the well.
|WELL_PERFORATION |WELL PERFORATION: The Well Perforations table contains detailed perforation activity performed on a well. This is the puncturing of a casing or liner which allows passage of fluid. A well completion may contain many well perforations.
|WELL_TUBING_TALLY |WELL TUBING TALLY: A list containing details of tubulars that have been prepared for running, or that have been retrieved from the wellbore. Each tubing joint is numbered and the corresponding length and other pertinent details noted alongside.
|WELL_TUBULAR |WELL TUBULAR: The Well Tubular table contains information on the tubulars for the well. The tubulars can be tubing, casing or liners which are run into the well. A tubing string is a continuous length of pipe used to connect the producing interval in the well to the flow line at the surface. A casing string is a continuous length of pipe used to protect the walls of the well and to assist in interval isolation when completing the well. The table identifies each tubular string used in a single drilling phase of the well. Liners are used to prevent sand from entering the wellbore.
|WELL_ZONE |WELL ZONE: The WELL ZONE table contains the name of a zone described in a wellbore.
|WELLBORE |WELLBORE: A Wellbore is a path of drilled footage, from Well Origin (top/start) to a terminating point (bottom/end).
|ZONE |ZONE: The ZONE table contains the name of a zone described in a field or reservoir. A zone may be a regular or irregular belt, layer, band, or strip of earth materials disposed horizontally, vertically, concentrically or otherwise, and characterized as distinct from surrounding parts by some particular property or content.

== Operational Data

Operational data includes data that regularly and frequently change such as:

* Production data
* Well Activities – workover, recompletion, re-entry, etc.
* Well History-Well status history and production method history.

Production data is the key information that production engineers use as the basis for analysis, evaluation and optimization. It is the foundation data. Engineers needed to observe the production trend periodically, to better understand the reservoir flow character, and also to find the problems and opportunities to improve the ultimate recovery.

Right now, the PDM have created 11 operational data tables. Expanding is in progress.

[width="100%",cols="29%,71%",options="header",]
|===
|Table Name |Description
