== *Changelog in Joint MVP - November 2020*

=== Integrate with DSIS unit conversion service and support unit conversion

*API Service*

PDM API service has integrated DSIS unit service, whenever importing data into database, or change unit in the user interface, PDM API service will do the unit conversion for user.

*Two unit systems*

There are two sets of global unit system, which are field and metric.

*Change column unit*

Column header include column name and its unit. User is able to set customized unit for each column.

=== Export Data

When exporting data, if there are units in current data, the first row of excel will be column name, and second row of excel will be current unit. If there is no unit in current data table, the first row of excel will be column name, and second row of excel will be data.

=== Simple/Bulk Import Data

When simple importing data, there is an option for each sheet, unit included or not. If unit include d is checked, then the second row will be recognized as unit row, else, the second row will be recognized as data row.

The same operation logic

=== Common User Profile

Common user, is the user who has no admin permission.

When common user log in application, he is able to review his account information, and what permission he owns.

=== Data footprint expand

*New entities are added in data model:*

Asset Table:

New added entity type in data model, which is a special kind of organization entity.

Formation Table:

This tables represents a specific layer of reservoir rock through which fluids flow from a reservoir into a string of production tubing. This table can be used to prorate production from a production string back to individual formations.

Well Perforation Table:

The Well Perforations table contains detailed perforation activity performed on a well.

*Data tables grooming and enhancement include:*

Network Series Tables:

Network Table

A network system that conveys the individual-well production or that of a group of wells to a central system or terminal location.

Node

It is used to record the nodes information of networks, each record of the node will associate an entity (An entity could be a well, facility)

Network Node

Network nodes are the physical pieces that make up the network.

Network Connection

This table is used to maintain information about connections changes in networks.

Delete all the _Unit attributes from tables, and using meta data tables to manage the data base unit and user interface unit.

Delete never used tables from data base.

*Meta Data Table Enhancement*

Add `related_bo_attr_name' in `business_object_attr' table, which is used to bind two different attributes of same business object group. For example, to label Node_In_Name and Node_In_ID are relevant with each other. This binding is important and being used in import/parse process. When we do name to id conversion then using this related_bo_attr_name attribute value we are able to know where to write the converted id values.

Add `unit' attribute in `business_object_attr' table, which is used to define the unit of the attribute. When importing data into PDM data base, the API service will do unit conversion, and save data into database, to assure the value and unit are consistent with each other.

Add `unit_templates' table, which is used to list the unit system that PDM application are using.

Add `unit_template_details' table, which is used to define the display unit of the attributes in the user interface of different unit system.

Add `user_unit_settings' table, which is used to record the unit system that different accounts are using.

Add `user_current_unit_templates' table, which is used to record the customized units that accounts reset.

=== Application Functionalities Enhancement

*Well Detail Page*

The production chart can be expanded and restored.

The production chart will be timely refreshed based on the current unit.

The well test table works well.

*Home Page*

The three search suggestions work well.

The map will show the latest BOE label of wells.

*Well Type Reference Data View Page*

User be able to select, delete or change image(size is smaller than 200k) to be symbol.

User be able to customize to define the color in the grid view.

*Export Enhancement*

Export the data what user see in user interface.

*Filter Enhancement*

Filter add search functionality for the reference columns

*Grid View Dropdown list Enhancement*

Support to search from full data of current table for reference columns.

*Multiple column constraint values are relevant with each other*

When the parent table has multiple columns as unique constraint, and in its child table, these columns values are relevant with each other when select data in drop down list.

== Changelog in Joint MVP - June 2020

=== *Data footprint expand*

In this MVP1.0, more tables are created in PDM core data model, which including

*Facility Table*

A collection of surface equipment and meters which facilitate the production, injection or disposition of products. This equipment supports any operation in the processing, development and transportation of products, such as pipeline, tank, battery, etc.

*Facility Equipment Table*

This table can be used to keep track of which equipment is occupying that facility place at a given time. A single facility can thus be associated with many physical pieces of equipment over its life span.

*Network Table*

A network system that conveys the individual-well production or that of a group of wells to a central system or terminal location.

*Network Node Table*

Network nodes are the physical pieces that make up the network. They usually include any device than both receives and then output the production.

*Well Test Series Tables*

The Well Test table contains descriptive information concerning a test date, test type, and other general data. Th ese tests are used as an evaluation tool to help determine the potential of the reservoir or well.

In this MVP1.0, the subordinate of well test tables include well test flow and well test pump.

*Well Directional Survey Table*

The Well Directional Survey table contains header information about directional surveys which have been performed on a wellbore.

*Well Activity Series Tables*

Use these tables to track all activities and events in a well or well bore, including daily operations, downtime, production, operational or milestone events. Time and depth of the activity may be tracked.

In this MVP1.0, the well activity tables also include well production method history and well status history.

*Well Volume Daily Plan*

Use this table to record the production targets of the wells.

*Business Associate Improvement*

An improvement of this table, add parent information, which aim to build the organization hierarchy easily.

=== Admin panel to control user access and privileges

In this MVP release, PDM provides user privilege functionality. The role based access control model is used, which aims to simply the privilege work flow. Meanwhile, PDM provides user a friendly interface, which is easy to use, easy to learn and easy to operate.

The user who owning the admin permission can enter into Admin Panel. The admin can create new user, delete unused user, modify user basic information, reset password, and assign role to this user.

In the role page, there are default roles. Meanwhile, admin is able to create custom roles, and assign users to different roles.

=== Home page which supports quickly search and navigate wells

The home page of PDM is used to facilitate navigation to other pages on the site by providing links of commonly used functionalities, and provide search box, along with filter conditions, which help user to quickly get and navigate the wells those user wants to monitor or analyze.

*Search engine*

Users can locate content in search box for specific words,phrases or number, and find out the wells they needed. in MVP 1.0 version, only well table is supported, which means, user can only implement search relevant with well table’s data.

*Links of functionalities*

Through the links, user can enter into import data page or Jupyter page directly.

*What’s new*

Provide user a brief list of new features and enhanced functionalities. And be able to link to MK document and get more information.

*Video Tutorials*

Three video tutorials to assist users in learning how to use PDM product.

=== Newly add and improve APIs

*Read records API enhancement*

PDM improves the functions of Common API, which is used to implement rich query features, such as: specify select list, criteria filters, pagination, order by, aggregate, having filters, simple join, dynamic join etc.

*Add Hierarchy API*

PDM adds hierarchy API, which aims to help user to organize commonly used hierarchy data, such as Field and Well, Surface Network hierarchy. Then the user do not need to spend time to familiar with the data base and data structure.
