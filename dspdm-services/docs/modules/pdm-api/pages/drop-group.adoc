= Drop Relationship

You can drop a business object relationship along with its relationship metadata and physical referential integrity constraint from the system by sending the following request. Drop relationship will be equivalent to delete a business object relationship definition. Either you want to drop a simple relationship or a composite relationship the request will be same. Once you drop a relationship then you cannot recover it again.

Following are the conditions which should be met by the request to drop the relationship.

[arabic]
. Main request will be for `BUS OBJ RELATIONSHIP' business object.
. You can drop the relationship either by relationship name or by constraint name.
. If you provide both then the relationship name will take precedence over constraint name.
. If you provide relationship name then this relationship name must exist in the database.
. If you provide constraint name then this constraint name must exist in the database.
. For composite relationship you only need to specify the relationship name and all the relationship metadata records for this composite relationship will be deleted together using a single request.
. If the given relationship name or constraint name does not exist then the response will be an error.
