[#facility_equipment]
== FACILITY_EQUIPMENT

*Table Name: FACILITY_EQUIPMENT*

FACILITY EQUIPMENT: Generally, a facility is usually considered to be an object that exists somewhere on the earth (or under or over). In most systems, these facilities are given identifiers   that indicate a PLACE on a network, and not a specific piece of equipment. This table can be used to keep track of which equipment is occupying that facility place at a given time.   A single facility can thus be associated with many physical pieces of equipment over its life span.

FIELD: A geographical area defined for administrative and legal purposes. The field name refers to the surface area, although at times it may refer to both the surface and the   underground productive zones. In the United States a field is often an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on, or related to,   the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition. Fields are usually defined at a province/state level but possibly are done at the district level.

[#well_tubular]
== WELL_TUBULAR

*Table Name: WELL_TUBULAR*

WELL TUBULAR: The Well Tubular table contains information on the tubulars for the well. The tubulars can be tubing, casing or liners which are run into the well.   A tubing string is a continuous length of pipe used to connect the producing interval in the well to the flow line at the surface.   A casing string is a continuous length of pipe used to protect the walls of the well and to assist in interval isolation when completing the well.   The table identifies each tubular string used in a single drilling phase of the well. Liners are used to prevent sand from entering the wellbore.
