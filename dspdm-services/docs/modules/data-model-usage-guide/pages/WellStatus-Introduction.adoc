The faceted taxonomy in PPDM:

One approach to creating useful reference lists is to assemble various relevant properties into a logical set as has been done in ``Well Status and Classification''. The set is a faceted taxonomy, and each list is one facet in the taxonomy.

Each facet is constructed according to some simple rules:

* Each facet describes one property of an object or description, and therefore contains only one kind of information.
* The facets work together to tell a complete story about a well and its components from multiple points of view.
* The values in each facet should be mutually exclusive with values in other facets of taxonomy.
* Values in a facet may be hierarchical. Users should be able to select at any level of the hierarchy that is relevant to their purposes. Data retrieval or reporting may leverage the hierarchies.
* Unambiguous criteria must be used for the selection of any facet value. If more than one value may be appropriate to a business purpose, the business rules for selection should be reviewed, or the design of the facet may be flawed. Local criteria may be used to choose the best level in the case of a hierarchal facet.
