== Entities Relationship

There are 2 kinds of relationships can be implemented in PDM data model. One we call it hard relationship, and the other we call it flexible relationship.

In the chart marked orange, the relationship among them is hard relationship. For example, when a well is new drilled, it belongs to one field. This hard relationship will not change versus time. And a completion is punched on its wellbore, the wellbore belongs to a fixed well, this is another example about the hard relationship. Even though the well only has one wellbore, there will be an original wellbore of this well. It doesnâ€™t mean this well has no wellbore.

The other relationship example is equipment. Equipment represents the real equipment pieces. May be any kind of equipment, such as meters, gauges, pump motor etc. The equipment is always attached on a well, wellbore or a facility. The diversity is one characteristic of equipment. It is difficult to list all the measurement and specifications for all the equipment in the data model. The measurement and specification can be dynamically assigned to equipment, to adapt the differences among equipment and reduce the data redundance.

When the oil and gas is produced from the subsurface, the product must be transported to a facility where it can be produced or treated, stored, processed, refined, or transferred for eventual sale. The flow model is used to describe the flow connections for the product be transported from well to facility.

Besides above relationships, well-pool, well-zone can help user specify what the individual zones, or pools this well is intersecting. Even through completion interval and zone relation can indirectly get the well-pool, well-zone information, direct well-pool or well-zone relation can make the analyze easier.

The organization unit in the gray on the top include the geographical unit (country, state, county) and business unit (company, subcompany, 3rd partner). through hierarchy, use can build relationship of organization units, and assign field, well, facility to one or more organization unit(s), and versioned by date.
