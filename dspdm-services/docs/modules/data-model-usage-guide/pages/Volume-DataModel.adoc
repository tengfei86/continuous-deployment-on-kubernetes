|*Table* |*Description*
|xref:Data-Dictionary.adoc#product_volume_summary[PRODUCT_VOLUME_SUMMARY] |A summary of reported volumes for different types of fluids over a specified time period.
|xref:Data-Dictionary.adoc#rpen_allocation_factor[RPEN_ALLOCATION_FACTOR] |This table represents a factor used in calculations to allocate production from one entity to another.
|xref:Data-Dictionary.adoc#reporting_entity[REPORTING_ENTITY] |This Table represents reporting entity against which production data will be reported (ex. Lease, Well, Wellbore, Company, reservoir Etc.). This table will only be a placeholder for the actual data of entity and will be linked with actual data tables (Ex. Well) of entity in case complete information required for entity.
|xref:Data-Dictionary.adoc#r_reporting_entity_kind[R_REPORTING_ENTITY_KIND] |This table is reference and will store reporting entity kinds. For example, Well, Wellbore, Facility, Field etc.
|xref:Data-Dictionary.adoc#r_reporting_product[R_REPORTING_PRODUCT] |This table is a reference table and will store reporting product types of Ex. Oil, Water, Gas. The product kinds stored in this table will be linked with PRODUCT_VOLUME_SUMMARY table
|xref:Data-Dictionary.adoc#r_product_category[R_PRODUCT_CATEGORY] |This is a reference table for R_REPORTING_PRODUCT and it will store Product categories like Product Fluid, Service Fluid.
|xref:Data-Dictionary.adoc#r_reporting_flow[R_REPORTING_FLOW] |This table is used to store information for the types of volumes flow. Ex. Open Inventory, Closing Inventory, Production, Injection Disposition.
|xref:Data-Dictionary.adoc#r_quantity_method[R_QUANTITY_METHOD] |It specifies the available methods for deriving a quantity or volume. Ex. Allocated, Allowed, Estimated, Target, Measured, Budget, Forecast Etc.
|xref:Data-Dictionary.adoc#r_period_kind[R_PERIOD_KIND] |Specifies the periods of volume for reporting Entities. Such as Month, Day, Year to Date etc.
|xref:Data-Dictionary.adoc#pressure_temperature[PRESSURE_TEMPERATURE] |The pressure and temperature conditions of the measurement have a profound impact on the underlying ``value'' of the measurement. This table is used to store the reference conditions for pressure and temperature. The conditions are extensible, allowing for local measurement condition standards to be used.
|xref:Data-Dictionary.adoc#r_allocation_type[R_ALLOCATION_TYPE] |A reference table identifying the type of allocation factor that is used in calculations to attribute (allocate) a measured movement of fluid to several production entities.
