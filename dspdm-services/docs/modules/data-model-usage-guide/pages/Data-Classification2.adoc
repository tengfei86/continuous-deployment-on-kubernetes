= Classification by Use Cases

The data is ingested by different roles when user utilize these data to analyze the production trend, evaluate the performance and find potential problems.

From petroleum engineerâ€™s perspective, we can classify the data into *entities*, *hierarchy*, *flow model*, *product volume*, *well test*, *production decline analysis*, *down time event*, *well status* and *fluid analysis* nine parts.

The data model is designed based on these production analysis use cases, aims to provide users a completed and unified production data model.

We also aim to provide an easy, clear, extensible, and professional data model for user, and help them to optimize the production and reduce the cost, find opportunities, and avoid problems.
