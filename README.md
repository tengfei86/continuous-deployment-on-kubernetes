# Lab: Build a Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Jenkins and Kubernetes

For a more in depth best practices guide, go to the solution posted [here](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/jenkins-on-container-engine).

## Basics

This guide will take you through the steps necessary to continuously deliver
your software to end users by leveraging [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/)
and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) to orchestrate the software delivery pipeline.
If you are not familiar with basic Kubernetes concepts, have a look at
[Kubernetes 101](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/).

In order to accomplish this goal you will use the following Jenkins plugins:
  - [Jenkins Kubernetes Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin) - start Jenkins build executor containers in the Kubernetes cluster when builds are requested, terminate those containers when builds complete, freeing resources up for the rest of the cluster
  - [Jenkins Pipelines](https://jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/) - define our build pipeline declaratively and keep it checked into source code management alongside our application code
  - [Google Oauth Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Google+OAuth+Plugin) - allows you to add your google oauth credentials to jenkins

In order to deploy the application with [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) you will use the following resources:
  - [Deployments](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/deployments/) - replicates our application across our kubernetes nodes and allows us to do a controlled rolling update of our software across the fleet of application instances
  - [Services](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/) - load balancing and service discovery for our internal services
  - [Ingress](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/ingress/) - external load balancing and SSL termination for our external service
  - [Secrets](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/secrets/) - secure storage of non public configuration information, SSL certs specifically in our case
